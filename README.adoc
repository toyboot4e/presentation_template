= Presentation template

A project template with very basic supports.

See https://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoctor-revealjs/

== Setting up

Installing the gems into the project:

[source,sh]
----
$ bundle config --local github.https true
$ bundle --path=.bundle/gems --binstubs=.bundle/.bin
----

== Usage

If you have https://github.com/watchexec/watchexec[watchexec] and https://github.com/sharkdp/fd[fd] in your `PATH`, you can run `_watch` to automate converting your `.adoc` files in the `src/` directory:

[source,sh]
----
$ ./_watch
----

Then you'll see html files in `slides/` directory.

== Customization

`_render` sets some default document attributes. You can override them in your `.adoc` file or you can modify the script.

* options: https://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoctor-revealjs/#reveal-js-options

== Notes

`_watch` is stupid and it may matter in some cases.

We have to generate PDF via browser because reveal.js does not support it. To get PDF, add `?print-pdf` post fix to the URI of your html in your browser.
